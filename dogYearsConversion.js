/*Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.*/

//declaring myAge as a constant number
const myAge = 30;
console.log(`My age in human time is ${myAge} years.`);

//declaring earlyYeras as 2 to, for the first two dog years this value will change
let earlyYears = 2;
// 1 human year = 10.5 dog years
earlyYears = 2 * 10.5;

//for the other dog years declaring laterYears with the value of (myAge - 2), this value will change 
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
// after 2 years: 1 human year = 4 years
laterYears = laterYears * 4;

//declaring myAgeInDogYears with the value of (earlyYears + laterYears)
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
console.log(`And that make me ${myAgeInDogYears} dog years old. Young wright?`);
